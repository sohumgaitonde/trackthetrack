                "description": "\"You have to measure out your peaks, especially in an Olympic year. But I'm really happy with my fitness right now. In years past, I haven't been this confident in my fitness. So I'm really happy and just excited to race (against) the world champs, the American record holders. That's really where I see myself thriving and I want to optimize those opportunities.\" \u2013 Cole Hocker Former Oregon Ducks Cooper Teare and Cole Hocker have reunited and are training together in Blacksburg, Virginia under coach Ben Thomas. Teare spent last year working with coach Jerry Schumacher and the Bowerman Track Club before announcing his departure in the fall. He took some time to make a decision but ultimately decided to reunite with his college coach, who led him to his U.S. 1500m title in 2022 and qualified for the World Championship team. Last year, Teare did set a personal best at 800 meters and 1500m but he missed qualifying for the World Championships in Budapest. He got off to a strong start in 2024 by winning the U.S. cross country title just two weeks ago. For Hocker, he\u2019s just elevating his training under Thomas and is hoping to have a full healthy year in the leadup to the World Indoor Championships in March and then the U.S. Olympic Trials this summer. Last year, he got off to a later start to the season due to injuries but still managed to qualify for Worlds and then finished seventh in Budapest in a personal best of 3:30.70 for 1500 meters. Both guys have been added to the men\u2019s two-mile field at the Millrose Games on February 11th in New York City. The field includes 1500m world champion Josh Kerr and U.S. 5000m and 10,000m record holder Grant Fisher. The Millrose Games is the sixth stop on the 2024 \u2060World Athletics Indoor Tour\u2060 Gold calendar. Livestream and television broadcast details will be announced in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more Millrose Games athlete announcements as the pro fields come together. Tickets to the 116th Millrose Games can be purchased online at \u2060millrosegames.org\u2060.

Worlds was something I\u2019ve only really done one other time. A big thing I wanted to take away from Worlds was just framing my mindset in a way that\u2019s \u2018You are as good as you think you are. You just have to go out there and act like it.\u2019 \u2026 I gained a lot of success really quickly so it\u2019s been a bit surprising. I\u2019m trying to focus on who I am as a runner and where I\u2019m supposed to be in a race.\u201d Yared Nuguse, the American record holder in the mile, claimed his first global championship medal with a runner-up finish for silver in the 3000m at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow last month. Nuguse will open up his 2024 outdoor campaign with the mile at the Penn Relays. He was also announced as one of the headliners for the Bowerman Mile at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon on May 25th.\u00a0 The former Notre Dame star is considered one of the favorites to represent the United States at the 2024 Olympics in Paris. He qualified for the Tokyo Olympics with a third place finish at the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. However, he scratched from the race while in Tokyo due to a quad injury during his warmup. In this conversation, Mac Fleet sits down to recap his 2024 indoor season and how he\u2019s taking lessons from competing at two global championships to work in his favor come the Trials and Summer Games.

It all started in Boston, where Yared ran a new American Record in the 3k, clocking 7:28.24. He followed up that performance by running yet another American Record (and the second fastest time ever) with a 3:47.38 at the Millrose Games Wanamaker Mile. Lastly, Yared flew to Europe, where he won a 1500m against a world-class field. Needless to say, Yared is on fire, and I had to get him back on the podcast.\u00a0  Yared runs for the OAC (On Athletic's Club), is a graduate of The University of Notre Dame, where he won NCAA Championships and set an NCAA Record, and was an Olympian for the US in 2020.\u00a0  This conversation was insightful, impactful, hilarious, and a ton of fun. Yared documents his last seasons at Notre Dame and how he overcame setbacks and failure, signing with OAC, training with \"heavy hitters,\" breaking two American Records this season, future goals for the rest of the year, sneaking his pet tortoise Tyro across the country, and who has the best dog on OAC (sorry, Gus.)\u00a0  Needless to say, through listening, you'll be inspired, motivated, and have many laughs along the way.\u00a0  You can listen wherever you find your podcasts by searching, \"The Running Effect Podcast.\" If you enjoy the podcast, please consider following us on Spotify and Apple Podcasts and giving us a five-star review!

I think we all did it and it's so cool \u2013 obviously, it's indoors and sure there's an asterisk because it's not the Olympics or World Outdoor Champs, but it's a race when it matters. It's a championship.\u00a0There are medals on the line and we are so competitive. We're going to run fearless. We're going to be like Hobbs Kessler, who is 20 years old and led that whole thing or Emily (Mackay)\u00a0in\u00a0her first world champs and she's like, 'F**k\u00a0it. I'm just going to take the lead.' We're going to make bold moves. We're gonna be really hard to beat. And I think that's the momentum we're taking into outdoors. That's a statement we're making.\" This is Nikki Hiltz's fifth time on the show. Our last interviews came after last summer\u2019s World Championships in Budapest and also after they broke the U.S. outdoor mile record at the Monaco Diamond League. The hot streak has continued into 2024. Last month, Hiltz won the U.S. Indoor Championships for the second consecutive season. And just this past weekend, they ran two personal bests at the World Indoor Championships to earn a silver medal in the 1500m final. Ethiopia\u2019s Freweyi Hailu earned gold in 4:01.46. Hiltz came in less than a second behind her for the third-fastest indoor 1500m performance in U.S. history. Team New Balance Boston\u2019s Emily Mackay finished third for bronze. The U.S. had a super strong showing at the World Indoor Championships. We topped the medal table with 20 total medals. Seven of those medals came in middle distance events \u2013 including four in the 1500m between Hiltz, Mackay, Cole Hocker and Hobbs Kessler. In this episode, Nikki recaps their whole trip to Glasgow, the learnings from another World Championship experience, the statement made by American middle distance runners and how their outlook shifts to the outdoor season now.

                "description": "\"For the longest time, my definition of mental toughness was being in the call room and not being scared and not being nervous. As I get older, I think mental toughness or mental resilience is being scared, being nervous, but knowing you're mentally robust and that you can handle these stressful situations. And trusting your fitness is there, trusting yourself and your instincts, that all the pieces are there and it's not going to fail. It's okay to be nervous.\" It's been almost three years since Hobbs Kessler joined the CITIUS MAG Podcast. Back in 2021, he was a high school phenom out of Michigan before turning pro ahead of the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. Now, he's the world champion and world record holder in the road mile. We caught up just two days after he ran 3:48.86 to finish second in the Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games to become the second-fastest American man in history. In this episode, he opens up about his training and adjustments he's made \u2013 including not running any run longer than seven miles, doubling every day and still sharpening his speed. Hobbs also shares how he's changed in his approach to racing and feels that he belongs among the best pros.

As I get older, I think mental toughness or mental resilience is being scared, being nervous, but knowing you&#39;re mentally robust and that you can handle these stressful situations. And trusting your fitness is there, trusting yourself and your instincts, that all the pieces are there and it&#39;s not going to fail. It&#39;s okay to be nervous.&#34;</p><br/><p>It&#39;s been almost three years since Hobbs Kessler joined the CITIUS MAG Podcast. Back in 2021, he was a high school phenom out of Michigan before turning pro ahead of the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. Now, he&#39;s the world champion and world record holder in the road mile. We caught up just two days after he ran 3:48.86 to finish second in the Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games to become the second-fastest American man in history.</p><br/><p>In this episode, he opens up about his training and adjustments he&#39;s made \u2013 including not running any run longer than seven miles, doubling every day and still sharpening his speed. Hobbs also shares how he&#39;s changed in his approach to racing and feels that he belongs among the best pros.</p><br/><p>Time Stamps:</p><br/><p>4:39 - Recalling his first summer as a pro.</p><br/><p>5:15 - His confidence before becoming an established pro.\u00a0</p><br/><p>6:23 - Some of the low points he\u2019s experienced over the past two years.</p><br/><p>8:16 - The people that have had the greatest impact on him.\u00a0</p><br/><p>9:07 - His training and mindset leading into the 2024 indoor season.\u00a0</p><br/><p>11:33 - What training in Flagstaff looked like for him in January.\u00a0</p><br/><p>13:57 - His training philosophy &#43; finding what training works best for him.</p><br/><p>17:50 - Experimenting with training.\u00a0</p><br/><p>18:31 - Breaking down his training structure.\u00a0</p><br/><p>20:19 - How he\u2019s been able to continue developing speed.</p><br/><p>24:13 - Race tactics and strategy.\u00a0</p><br/><p>26:08 - Goals heading into the Millrose Games Wanamaker Mile.\u00a0</p><br/><p>27:50 - Thoughts leading into Indoor USAs.\u00a0</p><br/><p>29:02 - Where his current fitness is at.\u00a0</p><br/><p>31:12 - Thoughts on the BU track.\u00a0</p><br/><p>32:20 - His favorite race.</p><br/><p>33:45 - What race he would re-run if he could do it over</p><br/><p>35:01 - Advice on managing nerves before racing.</p><br/><p>Host: Chris Chavez |\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chris_j_chavez\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060&#64;chris_j_chavez on Instagram\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060</a></p><br/><p>Guest: Hobbs Kessler | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hobbs_kessler/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u2060\u2060\u2060&#64;hobbs_kessler on Instagram\u2060\u2060</a></p><br/><p>SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</p><br/><p>&#x1f34a; OLIPOP\u00a0is a prebiotic soda with only 2-5g of sugar that is good for your gut health. \u2013 and it&#39;s delicious.

We pay our respects. Then we turn to an amazing 2024 Millrose Games where Devynne Charlton started things off by breaking the world record in the 60m hurdles but the highlight was Josh Kerr running 8:00.67 to break the 2-mile world record and take down Grant Fisher, plus American records by Ellie St. Pierre, a big run by Yared Nuguse, Hobbs Kessler and even Cole Hocker.

                "description": "LIKE | SUBSCRIBE | SHARE (:  In episode fifty-four of The Running Effect, I have the great privilege of speaking with Nico Young. Nico is undoubtedly one of the greatest prep stars that America has ever had. In high school, Nico cemented himself as one of the greatest high school runners ever (in my opinion he's the greatest). In just his senior year, he went undefeated all year and won NXN setting a course record along the way despite horrible conditions. He was also excellent in the classroom with a 4.68 GPA. Excelling both academically and in running, Nico won the 2019-2020 Gatorade Boys Cross Country & Track and Field Player of the Year. An award reserved for only the best of the best. Due to the pandemic, Nico never got the chance to compete his senior year track season which makes his high school career accolades all the more impressive!  After Nico graduated high school, he then went onto attend Northern Arizona University (NAU). At NAU, Nico has only continued to flourish. Within just two years, Nico is one of the top runners in the NCAA. Last summer Nico qualified for the US Olympic Trials placing 9th in the 5k final beating a handful of professionals. He has also placed top-ten at multiple NCAA championships and helped his team win team titles.  Nico currently holds the US High School National Records in the 2k & 3k and US U20 indoor and outdoor 5k records.  Many people see the results, but don't see all the work that went into the result. In this episode, we try to unpack Nico's successful career the best we can! We do a big deep dive into Nico's career from his start in the sport in fifth grade to his future in the sport. We talk about pressure, having a \"process over outcomes\" mindset, working on the mental side of running, working with two amazing coaches in his career (Mike Smith and Sean Brosnan), NCAA Championships, what makes NAU special, and so so much more!  It was an absolute pleasure to talk with Nico and get a deeper understanding of his journey in this sport! I can't wait to see what the future holds for him. The saying \"The sky is the limit\" is truly the case for Nico Young.  Nico's high school coach encapsulates just how special Nico is with this quote, \"I don\u2019t know when I will ever see another athlete with Nico\u2019s talent or ability to push himself beyond his limits along with the curiosity to see how truly great he can be. He\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime athlete.\"  If you want to help us out please like, subscribe, and share.
