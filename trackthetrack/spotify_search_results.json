We also talk a bit about Fred Kerley's big day and Sydney Mclaughlin's impressive open 400m as well. We jump into some NCAA Championship recap including the men and women's distance events and also get into the European Champs a bit.

                "description": "\u201cThe biggest learning experience was definitely Worlds. I feel like the other races are races I\u2019ve done a lot before and I know how they go. Worlds was something I\u2019ve only really done one other time. A big thing I wanted to take away from Worlds was just framing my mindset in a way that\u2019s \u2018You are as good as you think you are. You just have to go out there and act like it.\u2019 \u2026 I gained a lot of success really quickly so it\u2019s been a bit surprising. I\u2019m trying to focus on who I am as a runner and where I\u2019m supposed to be in a race.\u201d Yared Nuguse, the American record holder in the mile, claimed his first global championship medal with a runner-up finish for silver in the 3000m at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow last month. Nuguse will open up his 2024 outdoor campaign with the mile at the Penn Relays. He was also announced as one of the headliners for the Bowerman Mile at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon on May 25th.\u00a0 The former Notre Dame star is considered one of the favorites to represent the United States at the 2024 Olympics in Paris. He qualified for the Tokyo Olympics with a third place finish at the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. However, he scratched from the race while in Tokyo due to a quad injury during his warmup. In this conversation, Mac Fleet sits down to recap his 2024 indoor season and how he\u2019s taking lessons from competing at two global championships to work in his favor come the Trials and Summer Games.

That's really where I see myself thriving and I want to optimize those opportunities.\" \u2013 Cole Hocker Former Oregon Ducks Cooper Teare and Cole Hocker have reunited and are training together in Blacksburg, Virginia under coach Ben Thomas. Teare spent last year working with coach Jerry Schumacher and the Bowerman Track Club before announcing his departure in the fall. He took some time to make a decision but ultimately decided to reunite with his college coach, who led him to his U.S. 1500m title in 2022 and qualified for the World Championship team. Last year, Teare did set a personal best at 800 meters and 1500m but he missed qualifying for the World Championships in Budapest. He got off to a strong start in 2024 by winning the U.S. cross country title just two weeks ago. For Hocker, he\u2019s just elevating his training under Thomas and is hoping to have a full healthy year in the leadup to the World Indoor Championships in March and then the U.S. Olympic Trials this summer. Last year, he got off to a later start to the season due to injuries but still managed to qualify for Worlds and then finished seventh in Budapest in a personal best of 3:30.70 for 1500 meters. Both guys have been added to the men\u2019s two-mile field at the Millrose Games on February 11th in New York City. The field includes 1500m world champion Josh Kerr and U.S. 5000m and 10,000m record holder Grant Fisher. The Millrose Games is the sixth stop on the 2024 \u2060World Athletics Indoor Tour\u2060 Gold calendar. Livestream and television broadcast details will be announced in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more Millrose Games athlete announcements as the pro fields come together. Tickets to the 116th Millrose Games can be purchased online at \u2060millrosegames.org\u2060.

                "description": "The track is HOT. Okay, it\u2019s actually quite pleasant by Eugene-in-June standards, with temperatures in the high 70s and a pleasant breeze that always seems to be a tailwind in Hayward Field. But the performances laid down last night in Day 8 of the Olympic Trials sure heated up the stadium \u2014 even in events where we\u2019re not on finals yet. For the first time in history, three men broke 13 seconds in the same 110m hurdles race as\u00a0Grant Holloway\u00a0picked up his second national title, made his second Olympic team, and clocked the fourth-fastest performance in history ahead of\u00a0Freddie Crittenden\u00a0and\u00a0Daniel Roberts\u2019s lifetime bests. Five men broke 20 seconds in the 200m semifinals led by\u00a0Noah Lyles\u2019s wind-aided 19.60, and another epic battle between\u00a0Gabby Thomas\u00a0and\u00a0Sha\u2019Carri Richardson\u00a0is set up in the women\u2019s 200m final. While middle-distance rounds can sometimes get tactical, they sure didn\u2019t tonight. It took 4:05.36 to make the final of the women\u2019s 1500m, and the \u201cheavy hitters\u201d heat did not disappoint with\u00a0Nikki Hiltz\u00a0making a statement with a 4:01.40 win and five finishes at 4:02.14 or faster. The 1500m final will be absolutely stacked, and in the mixed zone competitors were suggesting that it may make times well under 4 minutes just to make the team. In the men\u2019s 800m, it\u2019s clear that qualifying for the Games in the 1500m has lifted a weight off\u00a0Hobbs Kessler\u2019s shoulders, as he seems to be absolutely elated in each round of racing and led all semifinal qualifiers with a huge personal best of 1:43.71. Kessler skipped the 1:44s entirely as his PB heading into this weekend was 1:45.07. It\u2019s now officially the weekend and, bittersweetly, our final two days of action, so make sure you don\u2019t miss any of these incredible competitions over the last few finals. If we\u2019ve learned anything form the action we\u2019ve seen so far, we\u2019re in store for something very, very fast in multiple events. CITIUS MAG LIVE From Eugene! will bring you daily interviews with athletes, coaches and notable folks in town at noon PT each day.

                "description": "\"For the longest time, my definition of mental toughness was being in the call room and not being scared and not being nervous. As I get older, I think mental toughness or mental resilience is being scared, being nervous, but knowing you're mentally robust and that you can handle these stressful situations. And trusting your fitness is there, trusting yourself and your instincts, that all the pieces are there and it's not going to fail. It's okay to be nervous.\" It's been almost three years since Hobbs Kessler joined the CITIUS MAG Podcast. Back in 2021, he was a high school phenom out of Michigan before turning pro ahead of the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. Now, he's the world champion and world record holder in the road mile. We caught up just two days after he ran 3:48.86 to finish second in the Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games to become the second-fastest American man in history. In this episode, he opens up about his training and adjustments he's made \u2013 including not running any run longer than seven miles, doubling every day and still sharpening his speed.

As I get older, I think mental toughness or mental resilience is being scared, being nervous, but knowing you&#39;re mentally robust and that you can handle these stressful situations. And trusting your fitness is there, trusting yourself and your instincts, that all the pieces are there and it&#39;s not going to fail. It&#39;s okay to be nervous.&#34;</p><br/><p>It&#39;s been almost three years since Hobbs Kessler joined the CITIUS MAG Podcast. Back in 2021, he was a high school phenom out of Michigan before turning pro ahead of the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. Now, he&#39;s the world champion and world record holder in the road mile. We caught up just two days after he ran 3:48.86 to finish second in the Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games to become the second-fastest American man in history.</p><br/><p>In this episode, he opens up about his training and adjustments he&#39;s made \u2013 including not running any run longer than seven miles, doubling every day and still sharpening his speed. Hobbs also shares how he&#39;s changed in his approach to racing and feels that he belongs among the best pros.</p><br/><p>Time Stamps:</p><br/><p>4:39 - Recalling his first summer as a pro.</p><br/><p>5:15 - His confidence before becoming an established pro.\u00a0</p><br/><p>6:23 - Some of the low points he\u2019s experienced over the past two years.</p><br/><p>8:16 - The people that have had the greatest impact on him.\u00a0</p><br/><p>9:07 - His training and mindset leading into the 2024 indoor season.\u00a0</p><br/><p>11:33 - What training in Flagstaff looked like for him in January.\u00a0</p><br/><p>13:57 - His training philosophy &#43; finding what training works best for him.</p><br/><p>17:50 - Experimenting with training.\u00a0</p><br/><p>18:31 - Breaking down his training structure.\u00a0</p><br/><p>20:19 - How he\u2019s been able to continue developing speed.</p><br/><p>24:13 - Race tactics and strategy.\u00a0</p><br/><p>26:08 - Goals heading into the Millrose Games Wanamaker Mile.\u00a0</p><br/><p>27:50 - Thoughts leading into Indoor USAs.\u00a0</p><br/><p>29:02 - Where his current fitness is at.\u00a0</p><br/><p>31:12 - Thoughts on the BU track.\u00a0</p><br/><p>32:20 - His favorite race.</p><br/><p>33:45 - What race he would re-run if he could do it over</p><br/><p>35:01 - Advice on managing nerves before racing.</p><br/><p>Host: Chris Chavez |\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chris_j_chavez\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060&#64;chris_j_chavez on Instagram\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060</a></p><br/><p>Guest: Hobbs Kessler | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hobbs_kessler/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u2060\u2060\u2060&#64;hobbs_kessler on Instagram\u2060\u2060</a></p><br/><p>SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</p><br/><p>&#x1f34a; OLIPOP\u00a0is a prebiotic soda with only 2-5g of sugar that is good for your gut health. \u2013 and it&#39;s delicious.

                "description": "\"You have to measure out your peaks, especially in an Olympic year. But I'm really happy with my fitness right now. In years past, I haven't been this confident in my fitness. So I'm really happy and just excited to race (against) the world champs, the American record holders. That's really where I see myself thriving and I want to optimize those opportunities.\" \u2013 Cole Hocker Former Oregon Ducks Cooper Teare and Cole Hocker have reunited and are training together in Blacksburg, Virginia under coach Ben Thomas. Teare spent last year working with coach Jerry Schumacher and the Bowerman Track Club before announcing his departure in the fall. He took some time to make a decision but ultimately decided to reunite with his college coach, who led him to his U.S. 1500m title in 2022 and qualified for the World Championship team. Last year, Teare did set a personal best at 800 meters and 1500m but he missed qualifying for the World Championships in Budapest. He got off to a strong start in 2024 by winning the U.S. cross country title just two weeks ago. For Hocker, he\u2019s just elevating his training under Thomas and is hoping to have a full healthy year in the leadup to the World Indoor Championships in March and then the U.S. Olympic Trials this summer. Last year, he got off to a later start to the season due to injuries but still managed to qualify for Worlds and then finished seventh in Budapest in a personal best of 3:30.70 for 1500 meters. Both guys have been added to the men\u2019s two-mile field at the Millrose Games on February 11th in New York City. The field includes 1500m world champion Josh Kerr and U.S. 5000m and 10,000m record holder Grant Fisher. The Millrose Games is the sixth stop on the 2024 \u2060World Athletics Indoor Tour\u2060 Gold calendar. Livestream and television broadcast details will be announced in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more Millrose Games athlete announcements as the pro fields come together. Tickets to the 116th Millrose Games can be purchased online at \u2060millrosegames.org\u2060.

                "description": "Last one, fast one?! The final day of the Olympic Trials was one for the history books. In every. single. event. that took place on the tracks yesterday afternoon, the Olympic Trials meet record was broken. In multiple events, simply qualifying for Team USA meant you had to produce a performance that ranked in the U.S. top-10 of all time. 12.37 in the 100m hurdles, 3:56.75 in the women\u2019s 1500m, and 1:44.12 in the men\u2019s 800m were only good enough for fourth place. The mantra of \u201ciron sharpens iron\u201d normally applies to training groups, but it certainly also applies to American track and field right now. When being top 10 in the world is not a guarantee of being top 3 in the U.S., the choice is simple: you elevate your game or you go home. The afternoon began with the 5000m final, where last year\u2019s U.S. champ\u00a0Abdi Nur\u00a0and this year\u2019s 10,000m champ\u00a0Grant Fisher\u00a0treated the fans to an epic duel over the final few laps. It took a sub-4 1600m to break the rest of the field, and in the final strides, Fisher was able to re-pass Nur and get his second title of the week, the first time he\u2019s completed the 10/5 double. Behind them, it was a similar battle for third between collegians\u00a0Parker Wolfe\u00a0and\u00a0Graham Blanks, and it\u2019s still not clear whether Wolfe or Blanks will end up on Team USA. Wolfe needs a few scratches in the world rankings ahead of him, and Blanks has the auto standard. In the men\u2019s 800m,\u00a0Bryce Hoppel\u00a0won his sixth straight U.S. title (counting indoors), but he did it in the fastest time of his career, a 1:42.77. His training partner\u00a0Hobbs Kessler\u00a0snagged third and qualifies for both the 800m and 1500m, the first time an American man has done that since 1976. In the women\u2019s 100m hurdles, you could throw a blanket over the whole field with two hurdles remaining, but it was\u00a0Masai Russell\u00a0who closed the best and clocked a 12.25, the good for #4 on the world all-time list. Rai Benjamin\u00a0did Rai Benjamin things in the men\u2019s 400m hurdles, cruising to a 46.47 world lead and meet record well ahead of the competition. The women\u2019s 1500m was an absolute battle \u2014 more on that below. And then we closed the weekend with\u00a0Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. McLaughlin-Levrone is used to being the star of the show, and honestly her biggest competition is usually the shadow of her past self. In the 400m hurdles final she had the benefit of a fast-starting\u00a0Anna Cockrell\u00a0on her outside, who stayed even with the Olympic champ for the first three hurdles and kept the pressure on early. But the real difference was that, coming around the final turn, McLaughlin-Levrone didn\u2019t shut it down like she normally does through the rounds, instead powering down the homestretch to an incredible new world record 50.65. For those keeping score at home, that\u2019s the fifth time McLaughlin-Levrone has lowered the world record. When she started, the world record she was breaking was Dalilah Muhammad\u2019s 52.16 from 2019, and now it\u2019s an incredible 1.51 seconds faster.

I knew when I crossed that line that it was going to be a decent time\u2026When I looked at the time, that was not what I was expecting to see there. That was pretty surreal. I\u2019m super, super grateful.\u201d Texas A&M junior Sam Whitmarsh popped onto our radar with a 1:44.46 at LSU\u2019s Battle on the Bayou meet on March 30th, which moved him to No. 7 on the all-time collegiate list.\u00a0 When we put the call out on the CITIUS MAG team for bold predictions for the 2024 season, Kyle Merber predicted that Whitmarsh would make the U.S. Olympic 800m team. Only U.S. champion and World Indoor champion Bryce Hoppel and 2023 NCAA champion Will Sumner ran faster than 1:44.46. The reason that people may not be as familiar with Whitmarsh is that his 2022 season was cut short as a freshman because he was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome \u2013\u00a0 a heart condition that leads to periods of rapid heart rate. In 2023, he was the SEC Championship runner-up and then only reached the NCAA West Regional in the 800m. This past indoor season, he missed qualifying for the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships by 0.01 sec. It feels like at every U.S. Olympic Trials or U.S. Championships there\u2019s a rising star out of the NCAA who can shake things up. Whitmarsh is looking like he could be that guy in 2024.

There was almost a nonexistent excitement for workouts and I was just kind of going through the monotony, but not enjoying it. And so changing it up, when you need excitement to love running again \u2013 being with VNTC guys lit that spark for me again. I am getting better at physical training and it's exciting with Hobbs. That guy's amazing and I just needed a new change of scenery.\" The kid from Midland, Texas went to the University of Kansas to chase some big dreams and now\u00a0Bryce Hoppel\u00a0is a\u00a0World Indoor Champion.

There was almost a nonexistent excitement for workouts and I was just kind of going through the monotony, but not enjoying it. And so changing it up, when you need excitement to love running again \u2013 being with VNTC guys lit that spark for me again. I am getting better at physical training and it&#39;s exciting with Hobbs. That guy&#39;s amazing and I just needed a new change of scenery.&#34;</p><br/><p>The kid from Midland, Texas went to the University of Kansas to chase some big dreams and now\u00a0Bryce Hoppel\u00a0is a\u00a0World Indoor Champion. It was won with experience as much as it was with fitness. It happens in the blink of an eye that the rookie becomes the veteran, but now Hoppel is in the prime years of his career.

Fittingly, it was the Kenyan who presented him with his World gold in Budapest in 2023.  For Marco, that moment was even better than winning the race and, in the near future, he hopes that they can find time to sit down together and talk all things 800 metres.    Having made his name as a front-runner, an athlete who likes to lead a race from gun to tape, Marco was finding it hard to hold on and win races at the highest level.  He\u2019s very candid about just how hard it was it for him go against his natural instincts and change his tactics, and how not making the final at the Tokyo Olympics was part of that difficult journey.  In the late 1990s, Marco\u2019s family fled the war in Sudan, eventually settling in Canada.  So how much contact does he have now with his family in Sudan?  Also, while he represents Canada, how aware is he of being a symbol of hope for refugees everywhere?  Finally, with some incredible times being clocked this year in his event, does Marco think that Rudisha\u2019s world record is on borrowed time?Image: Gold medallist Marco Arop of Team Canada reacts after winning the Men's 800m Final during day eight of the World Athletics Championships Budapest 2023 at National Athletics Centre on August 26, 2023 in Budapest, Hungary.

The flute, a slender instrument made from gleaming metal or polished wood, may appear delicate, but it possesses a powerful voice that can range from hauntingly soft whispers to joyous, soaring melodies. With nimble fingers and expert breath control, flutists navigate intricate passages and convey profound emotions through their performances. Whether performing in orchestras, chamber ensembles, or as soloists, they captivate listeners with grace, precision, and the ability to transport them to realms of beauty and wonder.  This episode will explore the lives and careers of some of the greatest flute players of all time. Through their exceptional artistry, technical mastery, and expressive musicality, these musicians have left an indelible mark on the flute world. The episode will highlight their significant contributions to flute playing and pedagogy, showcasing how they have inspired generations of flutists and enriched the musical landscape. Geoffrey Gilbert stands as a monumental figure in the history of flute playing, revered for his exceptional musicianship, technical brilliance, and profound influence on the flute world. An English flutist, Gilbert\u2019s career saw him assuming the role of principal flutist with several prestigious orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. His performances were characterized by an exquisite tone, flawless technique, and deeply expressive interpretations, leaving audiences spellbound.  Beyond his prowess as a performer, Gilbert was an ardent educator, imparting his vast knowledge and insights to students at renowned institutions worldwide. His pedagogical approach, emphasizing tone production, phrasing, and musicality, has had a lasting impact on the development of flutists. Many of his students have gone on to achieve significant success, spreading his teachings across the globe. Gilbert\u2019s legacy as both a flutist and an educator continues to inspire and shape the flute community, ensuring that his influence endures through generations.  Shifting focus to another titan of the flute, Sir James Galway, often referred to as the \u201cMan with the Golden Flute,\u201d has captivated audiences worldwide with his virtuosity, expressive interpretations, and charismatic stage presence. Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Galway\u2019s career has spanned several decades, during which he has become one of the most acclaimed flutists of his generation.  Galway\u2019s extensive repertoire ranges from classical masterpieces to contemporary works and even popular tunes, all delivered with his signature warmth and precision.
