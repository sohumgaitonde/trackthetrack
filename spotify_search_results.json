We cover New York City Grand Prix with Sage Hurta-Klecker's big W and Eric Holt's duel with Jake Wightman. We also talk a bit about Fred Kerley's big day and Sydney Mclaughlin's impressive open 400m as well. We jump into some NCAA Championship recap including the men and women's distance events and also get into the European Champs a bit. We live react to Jakob Ingebrigtsen's 1500m and earning a triple double gold.

In years past, I haven't been this confident in my fitness. So I'm really happy and just excited to race (against) the world champs, the American record holders. That's really where I see myself thriving and I want to optimize those opportunities.\" \u2013 Cole Hocker Former Oregon Ducks Cooper Teare and Cole Hocker have reunited and are training together in Blacksburg, Virginia under coach Ben Thomas. Teare spent last year working with coach Jerry Schumacher and the Bowerman Track Club before announcing his departure in the fall. He took some time to make a decision but ultimately decided to reunite with his college coach, who led him to his U.S. 1500m title in 2022 and qualified for the World Championship team. Last year, Teare did set a personal best at 800 meters and 1500m but he missed qualifying for the World Championships in Budapest. He got off to a strong start in 2024 by winning the U.S. cross country title just two weeks ago. For Hocker, he\u2019s just elevating his training under Thomas and is hoping to have a full healthy year in the leadup to the World Indoor Championships in March and then the U.S. Olympic Trials this summer. Last year, he got off to a later start to the season due to injuries but still managed to qualify for Worlds and then finished seventh in Budapest in a personal best of 3:30.70 for 1500 meters. Both guys have been added to the men\u2019s two-mile field at the Millrose Games on February 11th in New York City. The field includes 1500m world champion Josh Kerr and U.S. 5000m and 10,000m record holder Grant Fisher. The Millrose Games is the sixth stop on the 2024 \u2060World Athletics Indoor Tour\u2060 Gold calendar. Livestream and television broadcast details will be announced in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more Millrose Games athlete announcements as the pro fields come together. Tickets to the 116th Millrose Games can be purchased online at \u2060millrosegames.org\u2060.

As I get older, I think mental toughness or mental resilience is being scared, being nervous, but knowing you're mentally robust and that you can handle these stressful situations. And trusting your fitness is there, trusting yourself and your instincts, that all the pieces are there and it's not going to fail. It's okay to be nervous.\" It's been almost three years since Hobbs Kessler joined the CITIUS MAG Podcast. Back in 2021, he was a high school phenom out of Michigan before turning pro ahead of the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. Now, he's the world champion and world record holder in the road mile. We caught up just two days after he ran 3:48.86 to finish second in the Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games to become the second-fastest American man in history. In this episode, he opens up about his training and adjustments he's made \u2013 including not running any run longer than seven miles, doubling every day and still sharpening his speed. Hobbs also shares how he's changed in his approach to racing and feels that he belongs among the best pros.

                "description": "\"We're here to medal.\u00a0We worked so hard and no one worked harder than any of us. You just have to do it on the day. I think we all did it and it's so cool \u2013 obviously, it's indoors and sure there's an asterisk because it's not the Olympics or World Outdoor Champs, but it's a race when it matters. It's a championship.\u00a0There are medals on the line and we are so competitive. We're going to run fearless. We're going to be like Hobbs Kessler, who is 20 years old and led that whole thing or Emily (Mackay)\u00a0in\u00a0her first world champs and she's like, 'F**k\u00a0it. I'm just going to take the lead.' We're going to make bold moves. We're gonna be really hard to beat. And I think that's the momentum we're taking into outdoors. That's a statement we're making.\" This is Nikki Hiltz's fifth time on the show. Our last interviews came after last summer\u2019s World Championships in Budapest and also after they broke the U.S. outdoor mile record at the Monaco Diamond League. The hot streak has continued into 2024. Last month, Hiltz won the U.S. Indoor Championships for the second consecutive season. And just this past weekend, they ran two personal bests at the World Indoor Championships to earn a silver medal in the 1500m final. Ethiopia\u2019s Freweyi Hailu earned gold in 4:01.46. Hiltz came in less than a second behind her for the third-fastest indoor 1500m performance in U.S. history. Team New Balance Boston\u2019s Emily Mackay finished third for bronze. The U.S. had a super strong showing at the World Indoor Championships. We topped the medal table with 20 total medals. Seven of those medals came in middle distance events \u2013 including four in the 1500m between Hiltz, Mackay, Cole Hocker and Hobbs Kessler. In this episode, Nikki recaps their whole trip to Glasgow, the learnings from another World Championship experience, the statement made by American middle distance runners and how their outlook shifts to the outdoor season now.

Il giorno dopo il primato riprende la firma di Ossama Meslek che a Metz ferma il cronometro su 3.36.04. Poi qualche ora dopo, sempre a Metz, Pietro Arese mette la sua firma sul record italiano dei 3000 metri al coperto, 7:38.42.

Sabato 27 febbraio Pietro Arese lo porta a 3:37.03 e dopo solo cinque giorni Federico Riva lo abbassa a 3:36.74. Il giorno dopo il primato riprende la firma di Ossama Meslek che a Metz ferma il cronometro su 3.36.04. Poi qualche ora dopo, sempre a Metz, Pietro Arese mette la sua firma sul record italiano dei 3000 metri al coperto, 7:38.42. Togliendo, dopo 27 anni, il primato a Gennaro Di Napoli (7:41.05 nel 1997 a Parigi).</p><p>Un fermento tra 1500 e 3000 metri che proiettano, il nostro ospite di oggi, Pietro Arese ai prossimi appuntamenti stagionali. Tra tutti l&#39;Europeo di atletica a Roma, 7-12 giugno e ovviamente le olimpiadi di Parigi, 1-11 agosto 2024.</p><p>Nella seconda parte il coach Fabio Vedana risponde alle domande degli ascoltatori in tema di corsa, triathlon e allenamento.<br />Crediti foto: Atl-Eticamente Foto / FIDAL Veneto</p>",

                "description": "\"You have to measure out your peaks, especially in an Olympic year. But I'm really happy with my fitness right now. In years past, I haven't been this confident in my fitness. So I'm really happy and just excited to race (against) the world champs, the American record holders. That's really where I see myself thriving and I want to optimize those opportunities.\" \u2013 Cole Hocker Former Oregon Ducks Cooper Teare and Cole Hocker have reunited and are training together in Blacksburg, Virginia under coach Ben Thomas. Teare spent last year working with coach Jerry Schumacher and the Bowerman Track Club before announcing his departure in the fall. He took some time to make a decision but ultimately decided to reunite with his college coach, who led him to his U.S. 1500m title in 2022 and qualified for the World Championship team. Last year, Teare did set a personal best at 800 meters and 1500m but he missed qualifying for the World Championships in Budapest. He got off to a strong start in 2024 by winning the U.S. cross country title just two weeks ago. For Hocker, he\u2019s just elevating his training under Thomas and is hoping to have a full healthy year in the leadup to the World Indoor Championships in March and then the U.S. Olympic Trials this summer. Last year, he got off to a later start to the season due to injuries but still managed to qualify for Worlds and then finished seventh in Budapest in a personal best of 3:30.70 for 1500 meters. Both guys have been added to the men\u2019s two-mile field at the Millrose Games on February 11th in New York City. The field includes 1500m world champion Josh Kerr and U.S. 5000m and 10,000m record holder Grant Fisher. The Millrose Games is the sixth stop on the 2024 \u2060World Athletics Indoor Tour\u2060 Gold calendar. Livestream and television broadcast details will be announced in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more Millrose Games athlete announcements as the pro fields come together. Tickets to the 116th Millrose Games can be purchased online at \u2060millrosegames.org\u2060.
