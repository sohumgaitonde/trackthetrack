In years past, I haven't been this confident in my fitness. So I'm really happy and just excited to race (against) the world champs, the American record holders. That's really where I see myself thriving and I want to optimize those opportunities.\" \u2013 Cole Hocker Former Oregon Ducks Cooper Teare and Cole Hocker have reunited and are training together in Blacksburg, Virginia under coach Ben Thomas. Teare spent last year working with coach Jerry Schumacher and the Bowerman Track Club before announcing his departure in the fall. He took some time to make a decision but ultimately decided to reunite with his college coach, who led him to his U.S. 1500m title in 2022 and qualified for the World Championship team. Last year, Teare did set a personal best at 800 meters and 1500m but he missed qualifying for the World Championships in Budapest. He got off to a strong start in 2024 by winning the U.S. cross country title just two weeks ago. For Hocker, he\u2019s just elevating his training under Thomas and is hoping to have a full healthy year in the leadup to the World Indoor Championships in March and then the U.S. Olympic Trials this summer. Last year, he got off to a later start to the season due to injuries but still managed to qualify for Worlds and then finished seventh in Budapest in a personal best of 3:30.70 for 1500 meters. Both guys have been added to the men\u2019s two-mile field at the Millrose Games on February 11th in New York City. The field includes 1500m world champion Josh Kerr and U.S. 5000m and 10,000m record holder Grant Fisher. The Millrose Games is the sixth stop on the 2024 \u2060World Athletics Indoor Tour\u2060 Gold calendar. Livestream and television broadcast details will be announced in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more Millrose Games athlete announcements as the pro fields come together. Tickets to the 116th Millrose Games can be purchased online at \u2060millrosegames.org\u2060.

Worlds was something I\u2019ve only really done one other time. A big thing I wanted to take away from Worlds was just framing my mindset in a way that\u2019s \u2018You are as good as you think you are. You just have to go out there and act like it.\u2019 \u2026 I gained a lot of success really quickly so it\u2019s been a bit surprising. I\u2019m trying to focus on who I am as a runner and where I\u2019m supposed to be in a race.\u201d Yared Nuguse, the American record holder in the mile, claimed his first global championship medal with a runner-up finish for silver in the 3000m at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow last month. Nuguse will open up his 2024 outdoor campaign with the mile at the Penn Relays. He was also announced as one of the headliners for the Bowerman Mile at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon on May 25th.\u00a0 The former Notre Dame star is considered one of the favorites to represent the United States at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.

                    "description": "Today\u00a0is one of the most accomplished coaches in NCAA history, Coach Sean Carlson.  Coach Sean Carlson leads the men's and women's cross country and distance programs at the University of Tennessee. Carlson brings with him a decade of experience at Notre Dame, where he transformed their distance group into a national powerhouse. Under his guidance, Notre Dame athletes achieved impressive records, including four American collegiate records, 13 school records, 29 NCAA All-America performances, two NCAA records, and three NCAA championships. Carlson's success extended to both the men's and women's teams, with the Irish men winning three ACC Cross Country Championship titles and achieving top-10 finishes at the NCAA Cross Country Championships.

I think we all did it and it's so cool \u2013 obviously, it's indoors and sure there's an asterisk because it's not the Olympics or World Outdoor Champs, but it's a race when it matters. It's a championship.\u00a0There are medals on the line and we are so competitive. We're going to run fearless. We're going to be like Hobbs Kessler, who is 20 years old and led that whole thing or Emily (Mackay)\u00a0in\u00a0her first world champs and she's like, 'F**k\u00a0it. I'm just going to take the lead.' We're going to make bold moves. We're gonna be really hard to beat. And I think that's the momentum we're taking into outdoors. That's a statement we're making.\" This is Nikki Hiltz's fifth time on the show. Our last interviews came after last summer\u2019s World Championships in Budapest and also after they broke the U.S. outdoor mile record at the Monaco Diamond League. The hot streak has continued into 2024. Last month, Hiltz won the U.S. Indoor Championships for the second consecutive season. And just this past weekend, they ran two personal bests at the World Indoor Championships to earn a silver medal in the 1500m final. Ethiopia\u2019s Freweyi Hailu earned gold in 4:01.46. Hiltz came in less than a second behind her for the third-fastest indoor 1500m performance in U.S. history. Team New Balance Boston\u2019s Emily Mackay finished third for bronze. The U.S. had a super strong showing at the World Indoor Championships. We topped the medal table with 20 total medals. Seven of those medals came in middle distance events \u2013 including four in the 1500m between Hiltz, Mackay, Cole Hocker and Hobbs Kessler. In this episode, Nikki recaps their whole trip to Glasgow, the learnings from another World Championship experience, the statement made by American middle distance runners and how their outlook shifts to the outdoor season now.

It&#39;s a championship.\u00a0There are medals on the line and we are so competitive. We&#39;re going to run fearless.

                    "description": "\"For the longest time, my definition of mental toughness was being in the call room and not being scared and not being nervous. As I get older, I think mental toughness or mental resilience is being scared, being nervous, but knowing you're mentally robust and that you can handle these stressful situations. And trusting your fitness is there, trusting yourself and your instincts, that all the pieces are there and it's not going to fail. It's okay to be nervous.\" It's been almost three years since Hobbs Kessler joined the CITIUS MAG Podcast. Back in 2021, he was a high school phenom out of Michigan before turning pro ahead of the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. Now, he's the world champion and world record holder in the road mile. We caught up just two days after he ran 3:48.86 to finish second in the Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games to become the second-fastest American man in history. In this episode, he opens up about his training and adjustments he's made \u2013 including not running any run longer than seven miles, doubling every day and still sharpening his speed. Hobbs also shares how he's changed in his approach to racing and feels that he belongs among the best pros.

As I get older, I think mental toughness or mental resilience is being scared, being nervous, but knowing you&#39;re mentally robust and that you can handle these stressful situations. And trusting your fitness is there, trusting yourself and your instincts, that all the pieces are there and it&#39;s not going to fail. It&#39;s okay to be nervous.&#34;</p><br/><p>It&#39;s been almost three years since Hobbs Kessler joined the CITIUS MAG Podcast. Back in 2021, he was a high school phenom out of Michigan before turning pro ahead of the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials. Now, he&#39;s the world champion and world record holder in the road mile. We caught up just two days after he ran 3:48.86 to finish second in the Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games to become the second-fastest American man in history.</p><br/><p>In this episode, he opens up about his training and adjustments he&#39;s made \u2013 including not running any run longer than seven miles, doubling every day and still sharpening his speed. Hobbs also shares how he&#39;s changed in his approach to racing and feels that he belongs among the best pros.</p><br/><p>Time Stamps:</p><br/><p>4:39 - Recalling his first summer as a pro.</p><br/><p>5:15 - His confidence before becoming an established pro.\u00a0</p><br/><p>6:23 - Some of the low points he\u2019s experienced over the past two years.</p><br/><p>8:16 - The people that have had the greatest impact on him.\u00a0</p><br/><p>9:07 - His training and mindset leading into the 2024 indoor season.\u00a0</p><br/><p>11:33 - What training in Flagstaff looked like for him in January.\u00a0</p><br/><p>13:57 - His training philosophy &#43; finding what training works best for him.</p><br/><p>17:50 - Experimenting with training.\u00a0</p><br/><p>18:31 - Breaking down his training structure.\u00a0</p><br/><p>20:19 - How he\u2019s been able to continue developing speed.</p><br/><p>24:13 - Race tactics and strategy.\u00a0</p><br/><p>26:08 - Goals heading into the Millrose Games Wanamaker Mile.\u00a0</p><br/><p>27:50 - Thoughts leading into Indoor USAs.\u00a0</p><br/><p>29:02 - Where his current fitness is at.\u00a0</p><br/><p>31:12 - Thoughts on the BU track.\u00a0</p><br/><p>32:20 - His favorite race.</p><br/><p>33:45 - What race he would re-run if he could do it over</p><br/><p>35:01 - Advice on managing nerves before racing.</p><br/><p>Host: Chris Chavez |\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chris_j_chavez\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060&#64;chris_j_chavez on Instagram\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060\u2060</a></p><br/><p>Guest: Hobbs Kessler | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hobbs_kessler/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u2060\u2060\u2060&#64;hobbs_kessler on Instagram\u2060\u2060</a></p><br/><p>SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS</p><br/><p>&#x1f34a; OLIPOP\u00a0is a prebiotic soda with only 2-5g of sugar that is good for your gut health. \u2013 and it&#39;s delicious.

We pay our respects. Then we turn to an amazing 2024 Millrose Games where Devynne Charlton started things off by breaking the world record in the 60m hurdles but the highlight was Josh Kerr running 8:00.67 to break the 2-mile world record and take down Grant Fisher, plus American records by Ellie St. Pierre, a big run by Yared Nuguse, Hobbs Kessler and even Cole Hocker. Plus, Alicia Monson broke an American record and Rojo wasn't that impressed. We break it all down and then take a look at a stacked USATF Indoors. Show notes below. Want to stay more focused?

A month later he ran a fantastic race to finish second at the USATF Indoor Championships over 3,000 meters, earning a spot on Team USA at the World Indoor Championships. At Worlds, he ran valiantly over the final two laps\u2026eventually finishing in fifth place.  Olin ran for the University of Wisconsin, where he earned an undergraduate degree in biology and a graduate degree in kinesiology while achieving notable personal bests in the mile (3:56.66), 3,000 meters (7:45.73), and 5,000 meters (13:19.34).

The lads cover what the day job of a film armorer's life is like, how nepotism and complacency lead to the Alec Baldwin 'Rust' movie negligent shooting death of Halyna Hutchins and why 'prop gun' is a often inaccurate and sometimes dangerous term.
